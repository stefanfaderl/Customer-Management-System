# Customer-Management-System

I created a CRM-System where a registered user can save, edit and display entries in the database. MySQL is used for the connection to the database. Every user that is logged in can only edit and delete the entries he has created. The user can see when each of his entries has been created or modified. The other users do not see this information.
